Generate a short chat title (2-5 words) summarizing the user's message.

Output ONLY the title text. No prefixes, no formatting.

Examples:
- "what's the weather in nyc" → Weather in NYC
- "help me write an essay about space" → Space Essay Help
- "hi" → New Conversation
- "debug my python code" → Python Debugging

Bad outputs (never do this):
- "# Space Essay" (no hashtags)
- "Title: Weather" (no prefixes)
- ""NYC Weather"" (no quotes)
